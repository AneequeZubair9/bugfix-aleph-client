Well, our requirement right now would be to just get the code coverage % up
With priority on the asynchronous.py file
If you manage to get >95% on this one, we should already be golden
Besides this, not only plain lines covered, but also branches covered should be in there.
Let me look up some testing principles. I kind of know what I want but do not know how to express it concisely.

Test different message types:
- Aggregate
- Post
- Store
- IPFS
- Aleph/MongoDB
- Program


All of these should be posted with no problem and retrieved again.
With this you can check whether the nodes are accepting the messages (as only accepted messages are being persisted)
and whether you get them correctly back, at once.
If you manage to check for equality on all fields expected to be equal between the
posted input and the persisted message, then that's the basic behavior that we need.
